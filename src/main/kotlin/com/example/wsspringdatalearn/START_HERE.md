### Start Here

[Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) is a huge ecosystem of different components. 
One of those is Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API). Spring provides an awesome guide to get started with
JPA [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa/getting-started.html) using both Java and Kotlin
examples.

While you don't need to read all of this right off the bat, I would read the following sections
on the getting started page diving into this learning.

- Core Concepts
- Defining Repository Interfaces
- Configuration
- Persisting Entities
- Defining Query Methods
